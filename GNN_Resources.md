# GNNs for Recommender Systems

## Introduction to GNNs

1. https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/: A self-contained introduction to what GNNs are, insanely detailed and pretty

2. https://distill.pub/2021/understanding-gnns/: If you understand convolutional neural networks, then this would help understand GNNs from that light
