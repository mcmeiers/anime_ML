# anime_ML

We will use this as a central document that will broadly define our project and the directions we take. Our goal can be pretty flexible depending on what people find interesting. Nominally we can start off with something simple and broad and refine it as we go. Accordingly, we will have to modify the model selection, metrics etc as required. Please feel free to edit this document as you see fit.

## Project goals
We want to build an ML model that can process information like name of the Anime, description, production studio etc. and predict how well it will be received. There are several potential goals for this project, including:

- A score predictor
- A recommendation maker
- A season rank predictor

## Potential subprojects/takeaways (Add more subprojects here and self-assign tasks)
- Data exploration and identiying potential issues with the data 
	- Writing notebooks with helper functions to enable data manipulation and visuaization (Michael, Karthik)
- Recommendation model selection 
	- Reading up about various models and assessing their suitability 
	- Coding them in notebooks and eventually we might want to build modules
- Natural language processing 
	- How to use information from show description, reviews etc
- UI design 
	- Some experiments with tkinter, QtDesigner etc
- Practice with GitHub, VS Code etc

## Data
To not bloat github, data should be downloaded on ones own and placed in the data directory. The subdirectory's name will be listed just above the data source.
